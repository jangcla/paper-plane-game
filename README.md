# paper-plane-game
The first attempt at creating my first video game.


Back Ground: 
My game is a simple obstacle dodging game. In the game you control a paper air plane the flies through a terrain with different obstacles that try to block your path. You have three different lanes to chose from( left, middle, and right). The goal of the game is to dodge as many obstacles as possible. My hope in the game is that as you pass more blocks the background will change indicating your current progress as well as a steady increase in the difficulty of the game. 

The game mechanics are very simple, the user is given 2 key controls to navigate through the game, either the "A" and "D" || "<-" and "->" keys. The objective of the game is to last as long as you can, and the background visuals will change the longer the player stays alive.
